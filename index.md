Hello there,

IÂ´m Jan! In my freetime I sometimes analyze data and build nice visualizations (aka Data Analytics). I have studied Industrial Engineering at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), Germany. For work look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-biederbeck/). 

If you want to reach out to me, write me an e-mail to hello [at] jan-biederbeck [dot] de. 

### Website
This website is built on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using a modified version of the [bay theme](https://github.com/eliottvincent/bay) from [Eliott Vincent](https://github.com/eliottvincent). It is hosted on GitHub Pages. The bay theme as well as this modified version are open-source, but the content of this page (pictures, text) are - if not mentioned otherwise - copyrighted. If you want to use parts of it, please reach out to me.

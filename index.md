Hello there,

IÂ´m Jan! In my freetime I sometimes analyze data and build nice visualizations (aka Data Analytics). I am a industrial engineer by profession and studied at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), Germany. For work look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-biederbeck/). 

If you want to reach out to me, write me an e-mail to hello [at] jan-biederbeck [dot] de.
